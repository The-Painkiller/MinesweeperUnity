# Introduction
A Minesweeper game with 3 difficulty levels made in Unity with MVC design pattern.

# Controls / Gameplay
Duh! Left click on a tile to uncover it(it could be empty, have a hint of how many mines are around it, or could be a mine itself, in which case you lose.) Right click to flag it as a mine, if you think it is. Uncover all tiles safely and you win!
